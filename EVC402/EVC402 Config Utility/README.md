    1.	Open Folder named ‘RunTime’
    2.	Double click on file named: ‘Setup.exe’
    3.	Follow the installation instruction for the Labview runtime engine
3.	Once the Labview RunTime engine has been installed you may now double click on the file called ‘EVC402 config.exe’ in the main folder EVC402 Config Utility.
